# Twitter-Fabric-Example-Android
Simply this is an android app, that uses fabric's twitter core to first
a- get user followers
b- get a followers tweet
these 2 functionalities aren't implemented directly in the sdk, but can be called by using the APICLIENT of twitter to access all the rest api's
-please note some apis have a max calls per 15 minutes window, so sometimes it won't return data
Feel free to use any of that code.
